# Changelog

Dated log of what shipped. Newest first. Append an entry when a feature
lands; keep entries short — the diff is the detail.

- **Project-docs convention + scaffold artifact type** (`a39c852`): every
  project gets the same three living documents — `docs/plan.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, a `CLAUDE.md` `## Status` pointer — so `/pickup` and
  `/handoff` are project-agnostic. New `scaffold` manifest type seeds the
  files at the target project root (create-if-missing, never overwrite,
  never uninstall; symlink-escape guarded), `base/rules/project-docs.md`
  defines the contract, pickup/handoff read canonical paths first,
  doc-updater audits the plan's "Now" against diffs. CLAUDE.md hard rule 9:
  installer behavior changes ship with deterministic tests (108 passing).
